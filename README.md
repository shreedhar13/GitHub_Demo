My first github demo
<br>
author -> shreedhar jagatap
<br>
1.I first cloned the github repository from my github account ,link->https://github.com/shreedhar13/GitHub_Demo.git<br>
2.and i cloned it in my local folder named GITHUB_DESKTOP using "git clone link"command on vs code terminal<br>
3.now i get like this,,,,C:\Users\shree\Desktop\GITHUB_DESKTOP\GitHub_Demo<br>
4.inside GitHub_Demo there is file named README.MD ,,,(MD->mark down)<br>
5.i created the new file index.html in C:\Users\shree\Desktop\GITHUB_DESKTOP\GitHub_Demo this folder<br>
6.i entered "git status" to check what modification i have done ,,,,<br>
7.if any modification is done then in terminal it is diplayed in red color....<br>
8.untracked ->new files that git doesnt yet track,,modified->changed,,staged->file is ready to be commited,,unmodified->unchanged<br>
9.to replicate these changes in ur github account ,,2 stage process is followed,,1.add,2.commit<br>
10.add->now added file are become staged,,adds new or changed files in your working dir to the Git staging area using "git add 'file name' " command.if there are many modification ->"git add ."<br>
11.after "git add .",,,all modification displayed in green color,,ie;file is at staged state
12.commit-> git commit -m "some message or comments for this modification so that it can help at the time of tracking history of modification"<br>
13.but these changes tracked at local system ie;in "Git" (which is present at local side).....ie;for every github repository there is a .git file,which keep track of each file/folder inside this repository<br>
14.to push it to github ,use -> "git push origin main",,,which push the changes which are done locally(ie;whatever changes u have done in repository it will tracked by .git file which is managed by Git application at local side) to remote(github website/your github account)<br>
15.push->upload local repo content to remote repo,,,,local repo managed  by Git application what u installed .<br>
16.after executing this command ,,,if it is first time push then u have to autohorize the github with ur account<br>
17.now visit the github ,refresh the page u see the chnages u have done in locally<br>
